Also see DX signaling unit; pulse-link repeater.
            early distortion. Distortion that is due to advanced arrival of parts of a signal. Signal parts are transmitted in a given sequence, each part in a specific time slot. A part that arrives ahead of the proper instant causes early distortion. Synonymous with negative distortion.
